# P3-IdentClases
## Observations
The main problems that I had during this excercise were really similar to the ones I had during the last one.

Because of that problems, I decided to redo almost entirely the class diagram.
In this new diagram I decided to focus more on the interfaces, using a class base and then having the different interfaces, like Qt or CLI, being subclasses of that one.

Also, as this was my first time making one of these diagrams, the code implemented will not completely follow this implementation. So in the final code somee of the things maybe different, but more or less the classes will almost remain the same.
